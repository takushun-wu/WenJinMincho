# WenJin Mincho
A large Han-ideograph character set Songti(Mincho) font suite mainly derived by [Source Han Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif) and Han glyphs generated by [modified Kage engine](https://github.com/ge9/kage-engine-2/), and the glyphs are mainly presented in China mainland glyphs standard(aka G source).

## Introduction
WenJin Mincho is a large Han-ideograph character set Mincho(Songti) font suite developed with Source Han Serif and its derivatives, using GlyphWiki data and Han ideographs generated by a modified version of the Kage engine to achieve full coverage of Unicode-defined Chinese characters and Han ideographs registered in the Ideograph Variant Database, with Unicode Han ideographs are mainly rendered in mainland China glyph standards. The font family adopts *SIL Open Font License*, which is free for commercial use by any individual or organization.

There are relatively few free commercial and even open source large Han-ideograph character sets, and almost none of the free commercial large Han-ideograph character sets for Mincho(Songti) are based on the mainland China glyph standards. Therefore, if you are looking for a free commercially available large Han-ideograph character set font, WenJin Mincho is a good choice.

In addition, WenJin Mincho also supports a variety of Chinese romanization(or phonetic notations) and Zhuyin systems, and is equipped with a variety of OpenType features that can be freely invoked, including glyph standard switching, support for Chinese romanization(or phonetic notation) and Zhuyin variants, support for Zhuyin symbols in vertical typesetting, correct positioning of combining characters, and punctuation extrusion.

Before using the WenJin Mincho font suite, it is highly recommended that you read the following manual in order to fully utilize the features provided by the font suite.

## Introduction
WenJin Mincho is a large Han-ideograph character set Mincho(Songti) font suite developed with Source Han Serif and its derivatives, using GlyphWiki data and Han ideographs generated by a modified version of the Kage engine to achieve full coverage of Unicode-defined Chinese characters and Han ideographs registered in the Ideograph Variant Database, with Unicode Han ideographs are mainly rendered in mainland China glyph standards. The font family adopts *SIL Open Font License*, which is free for commercial use by any individual or organization.

There are relatively few free commercial and even open source large Han-ideograph character sets, and almost none of the free commercial large Han-ideograph character sets for Mincho(Songti) are based on the mainland China glyph standards. Therefore, if you are looking for a free commercially available large Han-ideograph character set font, WenJin Mincho is a good choice.

In addition, WenJin Mincho also supports a variety of Chinese romanization(or phonetic notations) and Zhuyin systems, and is equipped with a variety of OpenType features that can be freely invoked, including glyph standard switching, support for Chinese romanization(or phonetic notation) and Zhuyin variants, support for Zhuyin symbols in vertical typesetting, correct positioning of combining characters, and punctuation extrusion.

Before using the WenJin Mincho font suite, it is highly recommended that you read the following manual in order to fully utilize the features provided by the font suite.

## About font format...
- This font is categorized into Standard OTF`otf/WenJinMinchoP#-Regular.otf` (PostScript curves), Standard TTF`ttf/WenJinMinchoP#-Regular.ttf` (TrueType curves), Compact line-spacing TTF version`ttf/WenJinMinchoCP#-Regular.ttf` and Windows GDI compatible TTF version`ttf/WenJinMinchoWP#-Regular.ttf`. Users can choose any one of them to install according to the actual situation;
- Each version is divided into a TTC/OTC integration package version and three separate TTF/OTF font file versions, users only need to choose one to install.

### Suggestions for version selection:
- Windows system is recommended to choose the TTF version of the installation, if you often use Adobe design software, you can choose the OTF version (OTF version of the font file in Microsoft Office can not be embedded fonts, at the same time, its own export PDF function can not be converted into a copy of the text);
- macOS/iOS/Linux/BSD/Android and other Unix(-like) systems are recommended to choose the OTF version of the installation;
- In addition, we also provide a compact line-spacing version of the TTF version (font/zip file name with a “C” version). In Microsoft Word and other environments, there will not be too much space between lines (by default, the effect is similar to the “DengXian”, “SimSun” and other fonts).
- If you mainly use applications based on Windows GDI environment in Windows system (e.g. Word 2010, BabelStone Pad), you find that quotation marks are displayed in western form, the left quotation mark is located on the left side in Word 2010 with a blank space; or some punctuation marks are displayed in western form (proportional, instead of Chinese full-width), you can choose the Windows GDI compatible version (line spacing parameters are the same as narrow spacing version). Or some punctuation is displayed in western form (proportional, not Chinese full-width), you can choose the Windows GDI-compatible version (line spacing parameters are the same as those of the narrower spacing version). **Other cases or non-Windows systems are not recommended** (only the Uniscribe shaping engine has the above problem; DirectWrite, HarfBuzz, etc. do not have this problem)
